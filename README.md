#_Find and Replace_

#### _A simple app built to search a large string for smaller string items and replacing them with finally a last specified string., 9/11/2015_

#### By _Austin Kincaid_

## Description

_Users can input a large string and two other terms. One of the extra terms is the term to be replaced. The second term is the replacement term for the first term._

_Example:_
* Input text: "Chimps are chimps!"
* Term to replace: "chimps"
* Term to replace "chimps" with: deer
* Returns: "deer are deer!"

* Runs this in the background: findReplace("Chimps are chimps!", "chimps", "deer")

## Setup

_This application uses JavaScript, Jquery, Mocha JS, Chai JS, and finally bootstrap for styling._

* git clone https://github.com/aceokay/Find-and-Replace

* Enjoy!
